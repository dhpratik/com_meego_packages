<div class="warning">
    This site serves as a demo site. It contains some data imported from the
<a href="https://build.pub.meego.com">MeeGo Community OBS</a>. As we don't
have any packages in the Extras repositories, some packages were imported
from user home projects. The interface shown here is intended for MeeGo
community application developers and serves as a starting point for the
community QA process for apps. This is NOT the Apps area for end-users.
Apps will be a separate view on top of this data..
