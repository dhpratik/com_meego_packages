<h1>Welcome to MeeGo Community Applications!</h1>

<div class="warning">
Please check how <a href="http://wiki.meego.com/MeeGo_Apps/design">the new site design</a> is shaping up.
HTML mockups are available soon!

<div class="warning">
This site serves as a demo site. It contains some data imported from the
<a href="https://build.pub.meego.com">Community OBS</a>.
<br/>
The interface shown here is intended for community application developers
and serves as a starting point for the community QA process for apps.
<br/>
As we don't have any packages in the Extras repositories, some packages were
imported from user home projects.
